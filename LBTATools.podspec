#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
#   * Write the description between the DESC delimiters below.
#   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!

For the most part, I do a lot of prototyping and enjoy using a large set of tools that help me avoid a ton of repetitive syntax.
